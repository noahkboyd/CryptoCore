To-Do:
- Variadic macros
- Pure C implementation - no intrinsics
- Check that everything works
- System checking
  - Add check for AES, SSE2, etc extensions
    - Figure out each extension that is used
    - Each for the public api should check for hardware acceleration
  - Add macros for different architectures
- Add support for modes
- multi-threading
